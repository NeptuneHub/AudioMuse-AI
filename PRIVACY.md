# **Privacy Policy for AudioMuse-AI**

**Last Updated: September 1, 2025**

We believe in transparency. This policy explains what information AudioMuse-AI collects and why.

The data collection is only applied for the specific **Collection Synchronization** function that you can select from the side bar menu (actually experimental).

### **Who We Are**

AudioMuse-AI is a free, open-source project. For any questions, including privacy-related inquiries, please use the contact form provided in the "How to Exercise Your Rights" section below.

### **What Information We Collect**

The information collection is only related to the online shared database. All the other functions donâ€™t require data collections.

We collect two types of information:

**A. Data You Voluntarily Provide (Song Analysis Data)**  
If you choose to contribute, you can upload analysis data about your songs. This includes:

* Title, Artist, Tempo, BPM, Key, Mood, and other musical attributes.  
* A numerical "embedding vector" that represents the song's characteristics.

This data is used to build our community database. We **do not** store your actual audio files.

**B. Data We Collect Automatically (Technical & Authentication Data)**

* **Authentication:** We use GitHub OAuth through Pocketbase for login. We only receive your public GitHub user ID to identify your account. We do not store a direct link between your user ID and the songs you submit in our primary database.  
* **Technical Logs:** When you use the service, our servers automatically log technical information. This may include your IP address, the request you made, and timestamps.

### **How and Why We Use Your Information**

Our goal is to create a collaborative music analysis tool. We use your data to:

* Build a shared community database of song information, so users don't have to re-analyze tracks.  
* Allow users to download analysis data for their music libraries.  
* Develop future features, like song recommendations based on musical similarity (NOT on your personal listening habits).

### **Our Legal Basis for Using Your Information**

* **Consent:** We process the song analysis data you voluntarily upload based on your **explicit consent**, which you provide when you choose to submit the data.  
* **Legitimate Interest:** We process technical logs based on our **legitimate interest** to maintain the security, stability, and integrity of our service.

### **Hosting, Data Location, and Third Parties**

Transparency is key. Here is where your data lives and who helps us run the service:

* **Hosting & Location:** All application data and backups are stored on servers provided by **Hetzner Online GmbH**, located in **Finland**.  
* **Backend:** We use **Pocketbase** to manage our database and user authentication.  
* **Authentication:** We use **GitHub** as our OAuth provider to log you in.

### **Data Retention**

* **Song Analysis Data:** This data is kept as part of the permanent community dataset, but you can request its deletion at any time.  
* **Technical Logs:** System logs containing your IP address are automatically rotated and are only kept for a short period (typically a few days to a few weeks) for security and troubleshooting purposes.

### **Your Rights Under GDPR**

You have the right to control your personal data. Your rights include:

* **The Right to Access:** You can ask for a copy of the data we hold that is associated with your account.  
* **The Right to Rectification:** You can ask to correct any inaccurate data.  
* **The Right to Erasure:** You can ask us to delete the song analysis data you have contributed.  
* **The Right to Withdraw Consent:** You can withdraw your consent for future data uploads at any time by simply not uploading any more data.

Please note, these rights apply specifically to your personal data (such as your GitHub user ID). The songs analysis data you contribute is collected anonymously and is not directly linked to your user account in our database, so it cannot be individually updated or deleted upon request.

### **How to Exercise Your Rights**

To exercise any of these rights, please submit your request through our secure Google Form:

[**Privacy Rights Request Form**](https://forms.gle/a47eBZu5E19oH62j7)

Please be aware that the information you submit through this form will be stored in Google's systems. We will handle your request privately and confidentially.

### **Changes to This Policy**

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
