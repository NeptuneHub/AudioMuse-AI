# Install these in your virtualenv. We intentionally exclude system-level
# components (ffmpeg, voyager index DB, etc.) which should be stubbed.

# Notes:
# - ffmpeg (system binary) is NOT included here — keep pydub/ffmpeg calls stubbed or
#   install ffmpeg separately on your machine if you want full fallback behavior.
# - voyager is a system-level vector index; tests should keep a small stub rather
#   than installing production Voyager binaries.
