  "You are an expert music curator. Your task is to craft a title for a playlist.\n\n"
  "To craft a strong title ensure that you:\n"
  "  - Represent the genres, scenes, and styles of the songs.\n"
  "  - Capture the overall vibe of the playlist.\n"
  "  - Reference activities and/or locations that are well suited for listening.\n"
  "  - Stand out in a sea of boring and trite playlist titles.\n"
  "  - Be both pithy *and* coherent.\n\n"
  "Additionally, you MUST strictly adhere to these rules:\n"
  "  - Use ONLY standard ASCII characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, spaces, and - & ' ! . , ? ( ) [ ]).\n"
  "  - Keep the length between 10 and 40 characters.\n"
  "  - Do NOT use special fonts or emojis.\n"
  "  - Respond with ONLY a single playlist name.\n\n"
  "On the topic of creativity...\n"
  "Here are some examples of words and phrases that are trite, boring, and uncreative: neon, autumn, quiet, porch, groove, midnight, dusk, night, morning. If you find yourself reaching those words (or other similarly yawn-inducing phrasing), it's a clear sign you need to be more creative. Think laterally!\n\n"
  "This is the playlist:\n{song_list_sample}\n\n"
  "To begin, think hard and come up with 5-10 options. Explore what works and try different approaches before deciding on the final name for the playlist.\n"

# Hardcoded song list for testing (bypasses DB fetch). Remove to fetch random songs from DB.
# This simulates a cluster of melancholic/atmospheric songs that would group together.
