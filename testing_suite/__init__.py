# AudioMuse-AI Testing & Comparison Suite
# Compares two instances (e.g., main branch vs feature branch) across:
# - API endpoints (results, response shapes, status codes)
# - Database quality (schema, data integrity, embeddings, track counts)
# - Docker container health and logs
# - Performance benchmarks (latency, throughput)
# - Existing unit and integration tests
